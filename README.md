# Microbial Isolate LiP Analysis Workflow
The **Microbial Isolate LiP Analysis Workflow** is a user-friendly computational notebook (adapted from the ["Viral Experiment LiP Analysis Workflow"](https://github.com/PNNL-Predictive-Phenomics/Viral-Experiment-LiP-Analysis)) for analyzing proteomic datasets, from a single microbial isolated organism, using Limited Proteolysis (LiP) and Thermal Proteome Profiling (TPP) standardized experimental sampling methods. This analysis workflow is a supplement to the published dataset collection "S. elongatus PCC 7942 Limited Proteolysis and Thermal Proteome Profiling Structural Proteomics [(JM-BH-DP3)](https://data.pnnl.gov/group/nodes/dataset/34088)" evaluating alterations in solvent accessibility and structural stability adaptation patterns, in response to environmental light perturbations, through structural remodeling of the proteome. See [Usage](https://github.com/PNNL-Predictive-Phenomics/Microbial-Isolate-LiP-Analysis/blob/main/README.md#usage) for additional requirements information applicable to source code reuse.

**Reference Input Files**

 - Sequence Annotation Collection (.FASTA) - Synechococcus elongatus (strain ATCC 33912 / PCC 7942 / FACHB-805) [UniProt Proteome ID: [UP000889800](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot.proteome:UP000889800)] (version: 2025-02-10; 2,657 entries)
 - Processed Datasets (.txt/.tsv) - FragPipe (v.21.1), equipped with MSFragger (v.4.0), [peptide](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/docs/tutorial_fragpipe_outputs.html#peptidetsv) and [protein](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/docs/tutorial_fragpipe_outputs.html#proteintsv) processed raw dataset results files

## Usage
User must specify the search software used to generate the input file in addition to the path of the input files and output files. This workflow currently only supports reference input files generated by [MaxQuant](https://www.maxquant.org) and [MSFragger](https://msfragger.nesvilab.org) search software outputs.
